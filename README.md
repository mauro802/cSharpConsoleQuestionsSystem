# ConsoleQuestionsSystem

This code is a simple console application written in C# within the "ConsoleQuestionsSystem" namespace. It includes a main class named "Program" with a static main method that serves as the entry point for the application. The program prompts the user to enter a number between 1 and 7 to select a specific question to run, or enter 0 to exit the program. Each question demonstrates basic programming concepts, such as reading input from the console, performing arithmetic operations, and using conditional statements.

Question 1 asks for the user's first name, middle initial, and last name, and then displays the name in three different formats.  

Question 2 requests two integers from the user, calculates and displays their sum and difference.  

Question 3 calculates the area of a circle given its radius input by the user, demonstrating the use of decimal numbers and basic arithmetic.  

Question 4 prompts the user to enter a single character and displays it back to the user, showcasing character handling.  

Question 5 involves a true or false question about geography, demonstrating boolean data type usage.  

Question 6 asks how many siblings the user has and responds with a message, demonstrating integer input and conditional output.  

Question 7 calculates the total cost of adult and child tickets based on user input, showing how to perform more complex arithmetic operations and display formatted output.  

The program continuously loops until the user chooses to exit by entering 0. For each question, the "ShowTitle" method is called to clear the console, display the question number, and format the output before running the selected question's code.
